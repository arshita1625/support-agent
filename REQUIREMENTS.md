üì§ File Upload API
Upload Document
Endpoint: POST /upload

Description: Upload a markdown document and automatically process it for RAG queries.

Request
bash

     -F "file=@policy_document.md" \
     -F "process_immediately=true"
Python Example
python
import requests

with open('policy_document.md', 'rb') as f:
    response = requests.post(
        'http://localhost:8000/upload',

Sample Input File (domain_policy.md)

## 1. Domain Suspension Policy

### 1.1 Suspension Triggers
Domain suspension occurs automatically under the following conditions:

- Incomplete registrant contact information
- Invalid email address in WHOIS record
- Terms of service violations
- Payment issues beyond 30-day grace period

### 1.2 Reactivation Process
To reactivate a suspended domain:

1. Update all required WHOIS fields through control panel
2. Verify email address by clicking confirmation link
3. Submit government-issued ID for identity verification
4. Wait 24-48 hours for automated verification

## FAQ Section

Q: Why was my domain suspended without notice?
A: Suspension notices are sent to the email address listed in your domain's WHOIS record. If this email is outdated or invalid, you won't receive notifications.
Actions: [update_whois, check_spam_folder]
Escalation: no_action
